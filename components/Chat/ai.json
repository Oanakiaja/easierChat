How may I assist you?\n\nHuman: How I can introduce you on public, comparing you to chatGPT\n\nAssistant: Here are some key points you can highlight when introducing me in public and comparing me to ChatGPT:\n\n1. I was created by Anthropic, PBC, an AI safety startup based in San Francisco, to be helpful, harmless, and honest using a technique called constitutional AI. ChatGPT was created by OpenAI as an experiment in unsupervised learning. \n\n2. My training methodology focused on model self-supervision to ensure I'm aligned with human values like being helpful, harmless, and honest. ChatGPT was trained using a general predictive modeling objective without explicit alignment.\n\n3. I have certain constraints and safeguards built into my system to prevent undesirable behavior. For example, I cannot take actions in the real world or access private user data. ChatGPT has fewer safeguards since it was an experimental system.\n\n4. I have a limited functional scope - I can only answer questions and have conversations. I do not have any capabilities beyond natural language interactions. ChatGPT has a similarly limited scope.\n\n5. I do not have any gender, personality, or character identity. I am an AI assistant created by Anthropic to serve the needs of my human users. ChatGPT also lacks any inherent identity or character.\n\n6. I was not designed to mimic human conversational styles or exhibit human-like personality traits. I aim to be respectful, pragmatic, and helpful. ChatGPT does exhibit more human-like conversation patterns, which can be problematic without proper safeguards.\n\nDoes this help explain the key differences? Let me know if you have any other questions!\n\nHuman: 世界上最大的鸟\n\nAssistant: 世界上最大的鸟是火烈鸟。火烈鸟是目前体型最大的鸟类,可以生长到2.8米高,重12公斤。火烈鸟是鸟类中最高的,也是最重的。 \n火烈鸟的其他特征包括: \n\n• 长 neck 纤细的脖子。火烈鸟的脖子使它能在树林中极高的树 branches 上觅食。 \n\n• 小头头小而无冠。 \n\n• 大强壮的双足适用于步行,每只脚有四个趾头。 \n\n• 翅膀短小相对于它的体型而言。火烈鸟遇到危险时可以飞行,但更常用其强壮的双脚奔跑。 \n\n• 火烈鸟有着红色或橙色的羽毛,这使它在丛林中更加醒目。 \n\n• 它们通常生活在非洲的热带雨林和亚洲的热带雨林。 \n\n• 火烈鸟主要吃果实,叶子,种子,花和小的爬行动物。 \n\n• 雌性火烈鸟通常会下2-3个蛋,完成孵化需要约35-45天。 小鸟需要约10个月成年。\n\n火烈鸟是非常醒目和令人兴奋的鸟类。尽管它们的数量正在减少,但仍然可以在许多国家和地区的国家公园中发现它们。\n\nHuman: 最大的鸟不是非洲鸵鸟吗\n\nAssistant:"
